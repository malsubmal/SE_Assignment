For the purpose of this prototype:
- Some fields and methods of some classes are omitted
- A pseudo database operation is used (refer to MockDatabase.rs)
- UC CarReturn is supposed to have its own database but alas :) only car rental status is recorded
- Certain Classes' fields are also used as their id (refer to fn getqueryfield(&self) of each Class)
